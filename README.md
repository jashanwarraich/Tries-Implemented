# Implemented Tries
## - Production level code
##### Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). If we store keys in a binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, where M is the maximum string length and N is the number of keys in the tree. Using Trie, we can search the key in O(M) time. However, the penalty is on Trie storage requirements
